# 👋 Hi, I'm Basil  
### SQL Analyst in Training | Physics & Data Analysis Background | Passionate About Real‑World Problem Solving

Welcome to my SQL & Data Analysis portfolio.  
I’m transitioning into data analytics with a strong foundation in **physics**, **data analysis**, **Python**, and **advanced SQL problem‑solving**.  
My learning style is mechanism‑focused: I break problems down, understand the underlying process, and build solutions step by step.

---

## 🔍 What I’m Currently Focusing On
- Advanced SQL query design  
- Window functions (ranking, running totals, moving averages)  
- Recursive CTEs for hierarchies, date generation, and pathfinding  
- CASE logic for classification and business rules  
- Python for data analysis and machine learning  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Power BI & Tableau dashboards  

---

## 🧠 SQL Skills I’ve Mastered
- **Joins & Subqueries**  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  
- **Recursive CTEs**  
- **Window Functions**  
  - `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`  
  - `LAG`, `LEAD`  
  - `SUM() OVER`, `AVG() OVER`  
  - Frame clauses (`ROWS BETWEEN`, `RANGE BETWEEN`)  
- **CASE Expressions**  
- **Aggregation & Grouping**  
- **Date & Time Manipulation**  
- **Data Cleaning with SQL**

## 🐍 Python for Data Analysis
Alongside SQL, I am actively building strong Python skills for data analytics and machine learning:

- **Pandas** for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis  
- **NumPy** for numerical computing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Scikit‑learn** for machine learning models (classification, regression, clustering)  
- **Statistics & Probability** for analytical decision‑making  
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling  
- Experience with major Python libraries used in real-world analytics workflows
